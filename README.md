# GoProHelper

Simple Python API for getting stuff done with my GoPro Hero5 Black.

A great deal of inspiration came from Konrad Iturbe's
[GoPro wifi hack](https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack) project on Github.


# NetworkManager

NetworkManager is used to programmatically connect/disconnet with GoPro camera WiFi.
